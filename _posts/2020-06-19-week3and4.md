title: Weeks 3/4 (June 8-19)
---

Over the past two weeks, my mentor and I have solidified the attributes we are interested in using for the cost function. The attributes are as follows: (1) the complexity of intersections; (2) the surface material of a pedestrian pathway; (3) the presence of obstacles on a pedestrian way, such as a fire hydrant or streetlight pole; (4) the presence of "curb bulbs"; and (5) the safety of a crossing. If I am able to successfully implement these aspects, I will shift towards thinking about the role of land use adjacent to a pedestrian way in the cost function; however, this will likely involve a more complex pipeline (accessing satellite imagery and subsequently extracting tags).

Once I knew which aspects of the built environment to primarily focus on, I concocted a tiny 20-node network to play around with different potential cost functions. The original network is pictured below:

I picked node 19 as the start node and node 20 as the end node, and ran a simple shortest path algorithm, which resulted in the path traced in the photo. As you can see, this path uses a crossing that is only controlled by signage as opposed to traffic lights and an unpaved stretch of sidewalk.

The cost function prototype I developed loops through all of the existing edges and updates their "distance" by a certain factor. The image below represents the network once the weights have been updated. Once again, node 19 is the start node and node 20 is the end node.

As you can see,

I am still unsure of:

Next week, I will be meeting with Nick, a graduate student who has created nearly all of the existing codebase. I will work with him to understand the best way to go about developing my cost function within the existing webapp. 

_(Note: a quick logistical update - as you may have noticed, I have shifted to providing updates every other week; this is because I am working part-time on this project for the next few weeks and I want to continue to update after every 40 hours of work for consistency!)_
