## About AccessMap

AccessMap is a tool that provides custom sidewalk and footpath routing directions based on a personal ability profile.

This summer, I will be working to expand the capabilities of AccessMap. Currently, the application focuses primarily on routing for people with mobility impairments. I will define a new cost function that accounts for unique obstacles faced by people with visual impairments.

At the end of the research period, the final report will be uploaded [here](files/finalreport.pdf).
